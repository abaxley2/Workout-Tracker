# Workout-Tracker

## Description

This application is a demo of my abilities to use Mongoose object modeling to create a functional workout tracker.

This application starts with a homepage that allows the user to select between beginning a workout and adding to an already started one. It then feeds the data for the user's workout into a database to track it and provide a dashboard where two graphs appear and present previous workout information.
